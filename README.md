# Chatbot-using-python-using-Keras-NLTK

In this Python project, I designed a chatbot using deep learning methods. The chatbot was trained on a dataset that included categories (intents), patterns, and responses. We implemented a recurrent neural network (LSTM) to identify the category of the user's message and then provided a random response from the corresponding list.
